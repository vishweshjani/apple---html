    <p style="color: white;">Warranty
        The Apple Limited Warranty covers your Mac and the Apple-branded accessories that come in the
        box with your product against manufacturing issues for one year from the date when you bought them.
        Apple-branded accessories purchased separately are covered by the Apple Limited Warranty for Accessories.
        This includes adapters, spare cables or cases.
        Our warranty is in addition to rights provided by consumer law.
        Depending on the issue, you may also have coverage with AppleCare+. Terms and Conditions apply, 
        including fees. Feature availability and options may vary by country or region.
        If your situation isn’t covered, you’ll pay a fee. If the issue with your Mac is ineligible for
        service, you may pay the full replacement value.

        Battery service
        Your Mac laptop battery can be replaced for a service fee. Our warranty doesn’t cover batteries
        that wear down from normal use. <br>
        Your product is eligible for a battery replacement at no additional cost if you have
        AppleCare+ and your product’s battery holds less than 80% of its original capacity.
        <br>
        How much will it cost?
        Use our “Get an Estimate” tool to review potential costs if you get a service directly from Apple.
        If you go to another service provider, they can set their own fees, so ask them for an estimate.
         For a service covered by AppleCare+, your fee per incident will be the same regardless of which 
         service provider you choose. <br>
        Hardware service may no longer be available for some older products.</center></PRE>
